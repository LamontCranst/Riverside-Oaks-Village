This is a whole new village providing a number of mlos and maps to provide another area of RP.

Multiple mlos for residents, several business to operate, sell your stuff at the markets or the timber shed. A police and fire station to work out of. Be a dero and live in the hut or houseboat. Run hunting parties through the hills and valley. There is plenty of game to find.

CONFLICTS

If you find there is a map conflict, check the riverside_mapdata_files folder for game files that may be duplicated with other maps in the area.

If you have server_scenarios or any other scenario folder containing all scenarios installed in your server, this may conflict with the ymt file for this area. You can edit the zancudo_river.ymt file in the currently installed scenarios folder in your server.
Delete the riverside_scenario_files folder from this project if you edit the currently installed scenario folders. 
or
If you remove this folder, a mountain lion will spawn in the middle of the village and peds may bump into walls of buildings close to the road.
